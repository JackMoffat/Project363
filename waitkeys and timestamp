Determining when a key was pressed

It can also be useful know the time that a keypress was made (such as in studies of reaction time, though care needs to be taken if precise time estimates are required). We can easily obtain this information by providing a timeStamped argument with a timing clock:

import psychopy.visual
import psychopy.event
import psychopy.core

win = psychopy.visual.Window(
    size=[400, 400],
    units="pix",
    fullscr=False
)

clock = psychopy.core.Clock()

keys = psychopy.event.waitKeys(timeStamped=clock)

print keys

win.close()
